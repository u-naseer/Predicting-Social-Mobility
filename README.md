# Predicting-Social-Mobility
A project to predict opportunities for upward social mobility provided by different neighborhoods in USA. 
I use the data from US Census, OpportunityInsights.org and Center for neighborhood technology on neighboord (census tract) characteristics to understand correlations between upward social mobility (appropriately defined) with various features. 
A key part of the project is to cleanup and combine data from various sources to make it viable for machine learning. The end goal is a website/app which can: 

  a. Given neighborhood characteristics *now* can predict the opportunity for social mobility, i.e., predict some indicator of future well being.   
  
  b. Give policy suggestions for a given neighborhood to increase social mobility.    
  
  c. Suggest private individuals with a given economic condition, if they should move to a different neighborhood which offer more opportunity. 
  
Right now the project is in the data wrangling stage and I will keep this file updated as improvements are made.
